# Objectives:
# 1 - Improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
# 2 - Converting strings into lists, and vice versa.
# Scenario:
# An anagram is a new word formed by rearranging the letters of a word, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the phrases "rail safety" and "fairy tales" are anagrams, while "I am" and "You are" are not.
# Your task is to write a program which:
# asks the user for two separate texts;
# checks whether, the entered texts are anagrams and prints the result.
# Note:
# assume that two empty strings are not anagrams;
# treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
# spaces are not taken into account during the check - treat them as non-existent
# Test your code using the data we've provided.
# Test data
# Sample input:
# Listen
# Silent
# Sample output:
# Anagrams
# Sample input:
# modern
# norman
# Sample output:
# Not anagrams
