# Objectives:
# 1 - Improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
# 2 - Using the find() method for searching strings.
# Scenario:
# Let's play a game. We will give you two strings: one being a word (e.g., "dog") and the 
# second being a combination of any characters.
# Your task is to write a program which answers the following question: are the characters 
# comprising the first string hidden inside the second string?
# For example:
# if the second string is given as "vcxzxduybfdsobywuefgas", the answer is yes;
# if the second string is "vcxzxdcybfdstbywuefsas", the answer is no (as there are neither 
# the letters "d", "o", or "g", in this order)
# Hints:
# you should use the two-argument variants of the pos() functions inside your code;
# don't worry about case sensitivity.
# Test your code using the data we've provided.
# Test data
# Sample input:
# donor
# Nabucodonosor
# Sample output:
# Yes
# Sample input:
# donut
# Nabucodonosor
# Sample output:
# No

str1 = input("Is this string: ")
str2 = input("Hidden in this string: ")

i = 0
output = "Yes"
for char in str1:
    if char in str2[i:]:
        i = str2.index(char)
    else:
        output = "No"
        break
print(output)
