# Objectives:
# 1 - Improving the student's skills in interacting with the operating system;
# 2 - Practical use of known functions provided by the os module.
# Scenario:
# It goes without saying that operating systems allow you to search for files and directories. While studying this part of the course, you learned about the
# functions of the os module, which have everything you need to write a program that will search for directories in a given location.
# To make your task easier, we have prepared a test directory structure for you:
# Your program should meet the following requirements:
# Write a function or method called find that takes two arguments called path and dir. The path argument should accept a relative or absolute path to a directory
# where the search should start, while the dir argument should be the name of a directory that you want to find in the given path. Your program should display the
#absolute paths if it finds a directory with the given name.
# The directory search should be done recursively. This means that the search should also include all subdirectories in the given path.
# Example input:
# path="./tree", dir="python"
# Example output:
# .../tree/python
# .../tree/cpp/other_courses/python
# .../tree/c/other_courses/python
