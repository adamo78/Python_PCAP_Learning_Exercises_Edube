# Objectives:
# 1 - Improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
# 2 - Using built-in Python string methods.
# Scenario:
# You already know how split() works. Now we want you to prove it.
# Your task is to write your own function, which behaves almost exactly like the original split() method, i.e.:
# it should accept exactly one argument - a string;
# it should return a list of words created from the string, divided in the places where the string contains whitespaces;
# if the string is empty, the function should return an empty list;
# its name should be mysplit()
# Use the template in the editor. Test your code carefully.
# Expected output
# ['To', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be,', 'that', 'is', 'the', 'question']
# ['To', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be,that', 'is', 'the', 'question']
# []
# ['abc']
# []
