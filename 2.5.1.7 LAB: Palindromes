# Objectives:
# 1 - Improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
# 2 - Encouraging the student to look for non-obvious solutions.
# Scenario:
# Do you know what a palindrome is?
# It's a word which look the same when read forward and backward. For example, "kayak" is a palindrome, while "loyal" is not.
# Your task is to write a program which:
# asks the user for some text;
# checks whether the entered text is a palindrome, and prints result.
# Note:
# assume that an empty string isn't a palindrome;
# treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
# spaces are not taken into account during the check - treat them as non-existent;
# there are more than a few correct solutions - try to find more than one.
# Test your code using the data we've provided.
# Test data
# Sample input:
# Ten animals I slam in a net
# Sample output:
# It's a palindrome
# Sample input:
# Eleven animals I slam in a net
# Sample output:
# It's not a palindrome

strng = input("Enter some text: ")
fwd = strng.replace(" ","")
bwd = ""
for char in fwd:
    bwd = char + bwd
if fwd.upper() == bwd.upper():
    print("It's a palindrome")
else:
    print("It's not a palindrome")
