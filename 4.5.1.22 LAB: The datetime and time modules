# Objectives:
# 1 - Improving the student's skills in date and time formatting;
# 2 - Improving the student's skills in using the strftime method.
# Scenario
# During this course, you learned about the strftime method, which requires knowledge of directives to create a format. 
# It's time to put the known directives into practice.
# By the way, you'll have the opportunity to practice working with documentation, because you'll have to find directives
# that you don't yet know.
# Here's your task:
# Write a program that creates a datetime object for November 4, 2020 , 14:53:00. 
# The object created should call the strftime method with the appropriate format to display the following result:
# 2020/11/04 14:53:00
# 20/November/04 14:53:00 PM
# Wed, 2020 Nov 04
# Wednesday, 2020 November 04
# Weekday: 3
# Day of the year: 309
# Week number of the year: 44
# Note: Each result line should be created by calling the strftime method with at least one directive in the format argument.
